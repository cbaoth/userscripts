== User Scripts

My personal browser user scripts.

To run them first install a user script plugin in your browser:

* Chrome: link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo[Tampermonkey] _(same for other Chromium based browsers)_
* Firefox: link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/[Tampermonkey] or link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/[Greasemonkey]
* Vivaldi: Integrated

Then just click on the disered `*.user.js` file above and click on the `RAW` button on the top right of the code. The code should then be automatically caught by the plugin, asking you to install it or not. If auto-update is enabled in your plugin, you should always have the most recent script version (link to the repo provided in all scripts).

Note that not all of them are regularly updated or heavy used _(some might be outdated)_, and that I kept things simple _(for myself)_ meaning most scripts import a few libs that I regularly use. The latter shouldn't be much traffic overhead due to Tampermonkey's internal lib cache, but it might not be ideal performance wise _(works for me, no plans to change this soon)_.

=== Amazon Tweaks

** Adds a new _amazon_ icon next to the price with a direct link to the product's page _(short URL, no tracking, affiliation, etc.)_ e.g. for sharing.

|`link:dev/[]` | Just some code snippets, notes, etc. that can be helpful while developing user scripts.
|=======


== Q & A

* Q: Why are the hotkeys (sometimes) not working as expected?
** A: Most of these scripts disable hotkeys while an input field is in focus _(e.g. cursor in YouTube search field while playing video)_ to prevent accidental hotkey execution while typing. Check if this is the case _(e.g. click onto the player first to focus it)_.
