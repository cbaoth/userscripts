== User Scripts

My browser user scripts.

To run them install link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo[Tampermonkey] (link:https://www.google.com/chrome/[Chrome]), link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/[Greasemonkey] (link:https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/[Firefox]), or no extension at all (link:https://vivaldi.com/[Vivaldi]) and click on the linked `*.user.js` file, then click on "Raw" to install the script. Note that, except when using the integrated Vivaldi solution, the user scripts will be **updated automatically** _(default settings)_ as soon as I commit a new version.

=== Amazon Links

`link:amazon-links.user.js[]` adds a direct product link (no unnecessary parameters etc.) and a https://keepa.com[keepa] price search link next to the price on each amazon product page. +

* Copies the link URL when moving the mouse over a link while `alt` is pressed.
